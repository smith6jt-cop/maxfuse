# Example Data

Data files are hosted externally to keep the repository lightweight.

## Data Locations

For local development, data files are expected in the `docs/` directory
(maintained separately from version control).

## Download Instructions

- `docs/raw_feature_bc_matrix/` - 10x scRNAseq data
- `docs/1904_gene/` - Cell Ranger output

### CITE-seq PBMC
- PBMC CITE-seq data from 10x Genomics

## Usage

Notebooks in this directory expect data files to be present in `../docs/`.
Update paths in notebooks as needed for your local setup.
